<b>Basic of the internet and how it functions.</b>
<br>
<p>The internet is a global network of interconnected computers and devices that communicate with each other using standardized protocols. It allows for the exchange of data, information, and communication between users worldwide.
<br>
The internet operates on a client-server model, where users (clients) request services or resources from servers. Data is transmitted over the internet through a series of interconnected networks using protocols such as TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol). Devices called routers help direct data packets between networks to reach their destination.

<b>Basics of the web and how it works.</b>
<br>
<p>The World Wide Web (WWW or Web) is an information system accessible over the internet that allows users to access and share documents and resources linked by hyperlinks. It's built on top of the internet and relies on protocols like HTTP for transferring web pages. </p>
<br>
<p>Websites are hosted on web servers and accessed by users through web browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Safari. Web pages are written in languages like HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript, which browsers interpret to render content. Users navigate the web by clicking hyperlinks, which direct them to different web pages or resources. </p>
